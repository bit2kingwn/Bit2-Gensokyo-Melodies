# Bit2 Gensokyo Melodies
Welcome and hello hello, everyone! This is a simple page for playlist and content organization.

## New to Bit2? Start here!
- [Representative Video Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCPzClPadeI314lJlvqWIVZt_oLmerXAl) - I handpicked several videos in this introductory playlist. These are in my usual video style. If you enjoyed the style of music and the visual style, you might like my other videos too!

## Official Combined Uploads
- [Latest High-effort Touhou Covers](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCPzClPadeI3dM6xzHj_hbfGHlYXWPulA) - The playlist contains all recent proper music videos, sorted by newest uploads first.
- [Touhou Complete Folk/Acoustic Collection](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCPzClPadeI0L6wKYXtC1gfQ80AxhilSp) - Similar to above, but sorted by in-game order of appearance. For example, songs from Touhou 7 will come before Touhou 10, and Stage 1 themes will appear before Stage 5 themes.
