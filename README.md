# Bit2 Gensokyo Melodies
Welcome and hello hello, everyone! This is a simple page for playlist and content organization. "Bit2 Gensokyo Melodies" is the name of my hobby project, which is the main series of music videos on my primary Youtube channel, "[Bit2, Bobo & Reimu](https://www.youtube.com/@bit2kingwn)".

## "Helper" playlists
- [Latest High-effort Touhou Covers](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCPzClPadeI3dM6xzHj_hbfGHlYXWPulA) - The playlist contains all recent proper music videos, sorted by newest uploads first.
- [Happy Touhou Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCPzClPadeI3i-lhUqBqaVpAddpYIkC3C) - This playlist contains cozy and happy short arrangements and covers, featuring mini music, drawings, and maybe even a key take-away message :)
- [Touhou Complete Folk/Acoustic Collection](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCPzClPadeI0L6wKYXtC1gfQ80AxhilSp) - Similar to above, but sorted by in-game order of appearance. For example, songs from Touhou 7 will come before Touhou 10, and Stage 1 themes will appear before Stage 5 themes.
